In an ideal scenario, this page would let you input a city of your choosing and display the current and future weather information. The first obstacle I ran into when trying to code this section is that the API query needs the location to be in the specific format "City,State(or Country)" to process in the browser. Even when accounting for this I was unable to make the request go through. The only thing I got partly right was if you click on any of the cities in the left sidebar, it seems to perform the correct AJAX call and show the name, temperature, humidity and wind speed. The date, icon, and UV index ended up being omitted regrettably. Also, despite managing to get data to appear in 5 separate forecast boxes, the values are fairly arbitrary due to confusion about the JSON file, which gives info stored in arrays spanning 3 hour increments. Structuring these containers to line up neatly side by side proved to be yet another problem left unsolved. All in all I'm relieved that a couple of core components function more or less as intended, despite certainty that the code used to accomplish this doesn't conform to standard conventions.
